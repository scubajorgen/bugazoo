  <ul>
    <li>
      Just start Bug-a-Zoo as Applet or Java Application:<br>

  </ul>

  <H1>Introduction</H1>
  <p>
    Bug-a-zoo is a simulation of artifical life. In a virtual flat
    rectangular world creatures are crawling around looking for
    food. When a creature is well fed,
    it reproduces and pass their genes to clones of themselves. When 
    a creature does not manage to feed itself of gets eaten it will
    die.
    Successful creatures reproduce well in order to take over the World.
    Less successful creatures do not reproduce well and become extinct.
    However, on reproduction mutation may take place. The clone may be
    more successful or inferior compared to its parent. In the end
    the most fittest creatures will survive!
  </p>

  <H1>Concepts</H1>
  <H2>The World</H2>
  <p>
    The playground for creatures is the World. It is a flat rectangular
    space where manure grows and creatures can crawl around and interact
    with each other. The user can choose from a number of Worlds.
    Each World has its own rules, influencing the behaviour of the
    Creatures. For example, in one World creatures reproduce faster
    or can move easier around than in another World.

  <H2>Creatures</H2>
  <p>
    A Creature is a collection of Cells cooperating together. Each cell
    has its own	functionality. Following cells are possible:
  </p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
	    <img src="dragger.gif">
      </td>
	  <td>
        <b>Dragger</b>: a Dragger Cell is able to propulse the creature.
        A Dragger Cell receives signals from Sensor Cells. It
        sums all signals (Vector summation) and exerts a force on
        the Creature. The strength and direction of the force
        depends on the summed Sensor signals. The conversion from
        sensor signals.
      </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
	    <img src="manuresensor.gif">
      </td>
      <td>
	    <b>Manure Sensor</b>: a Manure Sensor Cell senses Manure. It
	    passes its signal to the Dragger Cells. If a Dragger Cell is
	    more
	    closely
	    to the Manure Sensor, it receives a stronger signal. A
	    Manure Sensor also senses Prey Consuming Cells (Predator
	    sense) from other Creatures and signals Dragger Cells to
	    move away from them.
      </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
	    <img src="manureconsumer.gif">
      </td>
	  <td>
	    <b>Manure Consumer</b>: a Manure Consumer Cell eats Manure and
	    supplies
	    the Creature with energy. Consumption starts when the Manure
	    Consumer Cell gets close to Manure. Consumption speed depends on
	    the distance to the center of the Manure.
      </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
	    <img src="preysensor.gif">
      </td>
	  <td>
		<b>Prey Sensor</b>: a Prey Sensor Cell senses other Creature's
		Cells.
		The	signal it receives becomes stronger when the energy
		of the other Creature's Cell is larger. The Prey Sensor
		passes its signal to the Dragger Cells. If a Dragger Cell
		is more closely to the Prey	Sensor, it receives a
		stronger signal.
      </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
	    <img src="preyconsumer.gif">
      </td>
	  <td>
  	    <b>Prey Consumer</b>: a Prey Consumer Cell eats other Creatures
  	    and
        supplies the Creature with energy in this way. Consumption
	    starts as soon as the Prey Consumer Cell gets close to other
	    Creatures Cells.
      </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
	    <img src="hybrid.gif">
      </td>
	  <td>
	    <b>Hybrid Cell</b>: a Hybrid Cell has a bit of the functionality
	    from
		all	Cells metioned above. It is a multi-purpose Cell. In
		the initial Hybrid Cells all functionality is present in the
		same amount. Other Hybrid Cells are generated by
		mutation. In these Hybrids all functionality may be not
		equally present in the Cell.
      </td>
	</tr>
  </table>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
          The colors of the Cell indicate its functionality. The border of the Cell
          indicates sensor functionality. The interior indicates consumer or dragger
          functionality. In Hybrid Cells colors are mixed according to its
          functionality.
      </td>

    </tr>
  </table>


  <p>
    In order to be successful a Creature has to reproduce and pass it
    genes to a clone of itself. In order to reproduce the creature
    has to eat food.
  </p>


  <H2>Manure</H2>
  <p>
    Manure is pure energy. A manure eating creature eats it and gets
    stronger. Manure grows and originates spontaneously when time
    passes. Since the World has a closed energy system, all energy
    dissipated by creatures returns as Manure in the World.	No energy is
    lost.

  <H1>Features</H1>
  <H2>Splash screen</H2>
  <p>
      After start-up of the software the splash screen shows. From here you
      can get Help (this page) or enter the software (Start).
  </p>

  <H2>The World screen</H2>
  <p>
      Here it all happens. Start the simulation in slow, normal or fast rate
      (Slow, Normal, Fast) or edit the World or Populations first (Edit)
  </p>

  <H2>The Edit screen</H2>
  <p>
      Enables you to insert new Creatures, whether entire predefined Populations,
      a prefab Creature or your own designed one.
